        Shepherd's pie is a comfort food casserole that originated in England.
        It's traditionally made with minced meat (usually ground lamb), gravy,
        vegetables, and mashed potatoes. You may also hear it called "cottage
        pie." The two terms are used interchangeably, but technically
        traditional shepherd's pie is made with ground lamb and traditional
        cottage pie is made with ground beef.

        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <p>
          Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and cook
          until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain and mash. Mix in
          butter, finely chopped onion and 1/4 cup shredded cheese. Season with
          salt and pepper to taste; set aside.

        <p>
          Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add carrots and cook
          until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, mash and set
          aside. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Heat oil in a large frying pan. Add onion and cook until clear. Add
          ground beef and cook until well browned. Pour off excess fat, then
          stir in flour and cook 1 minute. Add ketchup and beef broth. Bring to
          a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spread the ground beef in an even layer on the bottom of a 2 quart
          casserole dish. Next, spread a layer of mashed carrots. Top with the
          mashed potato mixture and sprinkle with remaining shredded cheese.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until golden brown.
          Serve hot and enjoy!
